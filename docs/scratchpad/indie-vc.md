Goal:

- "We are only interested in backing fiercely independent founders building potential futures they don't want to be left to the whims of a fickle investment community."
  - Idea: bloat, data hostage, 
  - Idea: small teams -> produce delightful software

  - Idea: we got burned down by companies diluting their culture and downgrading their user experience by their insatiable appetite for "growth" or the wild chase for that "next round". We've seen that at startups we've worked at, and products we used to love
  - Idea: We don't care about "power", we care about building delightful products 
  - Idea: we bleieve software doesn't have to suck. we care about craft, and 

- "Who believe that company cultures are set strong and early based on time-tested fundamentals as the most solid foundations for scale. And that controlling your own destiny and maintaining optionality is something worth optimizing for."

- "If you have a unique take on an emergent technology or opportunity, we should talk."

Hi Bryce,

I'm [Simon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/skorzunov/) and my co-founder is [Mirza](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mpasalic/). We were inspired and energized by indie.vc's vision. We've both been burned by companies diluting their culture and downgrading their user experience by their insatiable appetite for "growth" **or** the wild chase for that "next round". Our hope was to avoid these pitfalls through the boostrap path, so we've been working on a project late-nights (after our day jobs) to make that happen. But we're *itching* to commit full-time, and hence, your thesis resonates a lot with us. 

## What we are building and why

We've been passionate users of productivity tools like RayCast and Warp, and we want to bring the same level of innovation, polish and craft to the note-taking space.

Cloud has downsides: imagine being on the plane and working for hours on a Google Doc (which does support offline), only to land and discover that there was a conflict, and your work is gone. 

That highlights a fundamental problem today: your work and knowledge doesn't belong to you, yet it is way more useful than a text file on your hard drive, due to collaboration and backups.

We want to give agency and control back to teams and individuals without sacrificing features, UX, or privacy. We're betting on the convergence of several maturing technologies: small open-source AI models, CRDT, vector search, and Rust.

Shelv is our take on knowledge capture and management for tech-minded teams and individuals.

Our principles and how we can diffrentiate:
- Native, fast, and polished
- Local-first yet collaborative
- AI-native
- Simple, distraction-free

## Where we are today

Currently, Shelv is on TestFlight [TODO: add link] and we are conducting studies with a small audience of passionate users.

Today, Shelv is great for personal use:
- Optimized for idea capturing + exploring phase
- Plain-text editor w/ Markdown
- LLM-powered features [TODO: add link]
- Computation capabilities (markdown codeblocks that are executed inline)
- daily driver for us and several other people

We hope to rollout to a wider audience soon, and collect feedback to navigate what to tackle next.

That said, here is what we have in mind:
- Collaboration
- Long term storage and retrieval in a knowledge base
- Team features










(something about: we have ideas on where to go, but we're not 100% sure of direction. We are open to changing our mind as we learn more)

We have been working on Shelv on the side for about a year and initially wanted to bootstrap. Working late nights has proven to be quite a challenge for us at our stages in life, but we're *itching* to work on this full-time. Hence, we are exploring ways to achieve that.

We gravitate towards productivity

We want to tackle knowledge-magement space, here are some problems we see today
-  bloat
-  not optimizing for capturing phase
-  cloud based

Structure proposal:
- Initial thesis: Capture phase
    - Problems:
        - Speedy fast capturing
        - Distraction free
        - Plaintext
- What Shelv is today
- But... everything else
- Our vision for Shelv
    - Native, Fast, Polished
    - Data ownership
    - Local-first
    - AI-native
    - 


Problems
- Data ownership, the data doesn't belong to you
  - data interop, offline access
  - my data needs to outlive the app
- Simon sucks at taking notes, thus I needed an easier way to capture stuff, so I can do it more often



We're super excited to tell you about Shelv, our take on ?? . Initially, we built Shelv to solve for the capture and ideation phase of note-taking. Not all notes are meant to be eternal, and we didn't feel that apps like Notion were optimized for this use-case. Basically, remove all the bloat and distractions, high performance, local,  and let the creative process flourish. And it works.

~~In the era of cloud and AI, more of our data and control are going to "cloud" companies, such as Notion, OpenAI, and Anthropic. This is especially pronounced in knowledge-management systems (like Notion). Beyond philosophical arguments, there are practical concerns: performance (cloud reliance), data longevity, and portability.~~

[
What problem does CRDTs solve?

- Image google doc on a plane (sure, it supports offline) but then when your online "whoops you got a conflict! too bad!" 
- Experienced with notion too (especially once # of collaboraters increases)
- Cloud sucks. 
- I want collaboration but with control, history, merging, 
- "local" + "collaborative"

We want to give agency and control back to teams and individuals without sacrificing features, UX, or privacy. We're betting on the convergence of several maturing technologies: small open-source AI models, CRDT, vector search, and Rust.


## What we are building:

Shelv: Local-first, AI-native, collaborative documents for tech-minded teams and individuals.

In essence, we want to build a viable alternative to Notion + Google Docs for small technical teams (leaving all project management to tools like Linear).

We are focusing first on Capturing, Playing + Exploring ideas, and later on Retaining + Retrieval.

*notes*
* we've got capturing + exploring down, but we don't have collaboration yet
* what comes next? maybe retaining/retrieval or collaboration
- retaining/retrieval -> storage + organization / retrieval

Our principles:
- Native, Fast, Polished
- Local-first
- AI-first
- Collaborative
- Plain-text
