Hi Bryce,

I'm [Simon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/skorzunov/) and my co-founder is [Mirza](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mpasalic/). We were inspired and energized by indie.vc's vision. We've both been burned by companies diluting their culture and downgrading their user experience through their insatiable appetite for "growth" or the wild chase for that "next round". Our hope was to avoid these pitfalls through the bootstrap path, so we've been working on a project late nights (after our day jobs) to make that happen. But we're itching to commit full-time, and hence, your thesis resonates deeply with us.

## What we are building and why

We've been passionate users of productivity tools like RayCast and Warp, and we want to bring the same level of innovation, polish, and craft to the note-taking space.

The cloud has downsides: imagine being on a plane and working for hours on a Google Doc (which does support offline), only to land and discover that there was a conflict, and your work is gone.

This highlights a fundamental problem today: your work and knowledge don't belong to you, but we sacrifice ownership for the benefit of collaboration and cloud backups.

We want to give agency and control back to teams and individuals without sacrificing features, UX, or privacy. We're betting on the convergence of several maturing technologies: small open-source AI models, CRDT, vector search, and Rust.

Our project, Shelv, is our take on knowledge capture and management for tech-minded teams and individuals.

Our principles and how we differentiate:
- Native, fast, and polished
- Local-first yet collaborative
- AI-native
- Simple, distraction-free

## Where we are today

Currently, Shelv is on TestFlight [TODO: add link] and we are conducting studies with a small audience of passionate users.

Today, Shelv is great for personal use:
- Optimized for idea capturing + exploring phase
- Plain-text editor with Markdown support
- LLM-powered features [TODO: add link]
- Computation capabilities (markdown code blocks that are executed inline)
- Daily driver for us and several other users

We hope to roll out to a wider audience and collect feedback to navigate what to tackle next.

That said, here is what we have in mind:
- Collaboration
- Long-term storage and retrieval in a knowledge base
- Team features

We hope that we've piqued your interest and look forward to hearing from you.

Thanks,
Simon and Mirza
