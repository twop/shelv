### Current plan
- [x] KDL syntax highlighting (nice to have)
- [x] Menu icon bug
- [x] UI font ratio to text
- After getting a build...
	* Mirza and Simon share w/ their friends
	* Still "Friends"
		* James
		* Evangeline (and tricks her coworkers too)
		* Matt
		* etc...
	* Ultimate goal: Indie.vc application
		* The reason we delayed was to get more user signals
		* Current pitch idea: "Shelv is the best way to capture information"
			* "Hackable", "Collaborative" + "ADHD-approved" -> distraction-free, elegant and intuitive API, bloat-free, 
			* Maybe reach out to Stefan?
		* Strategy: Lean in on our strengths
	* 
- Other notable bugs
	* underlined links with larger line-height
	* collapsible text
