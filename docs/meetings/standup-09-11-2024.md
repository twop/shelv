# Check in - Sep 11 2024
Attendees: Mirza, Simon

Proposal:
- Milestone 1: Shelv meets the quality bar for "friends of friends"
- Milestone 2: Shelv is marketted online to 

Milestone: "Friends-of-Friends" 
- Versions of this:
	1. Use friends to "advocate for Shelv" -> goal is ~~growth~~ 10 users
	2. Someone we don't know asks to be invited to TestFlight. Are we comfortable? -> goal is quality bar
		1. Then, next step is growth

- We feel comfortable sharing to those users
- Are able to use Shelv without hand-holding / intervention
- When they try Shelv, they don't run into annoying issues (especially onboarding)

Goal: Capture these users (for example, Simon's gamer dev friends)

What needs to be done:
- (priority #1) Optimize/tweak onboarding flow (based on feedback)
	* Some way for old users to trigger onboarding notes
		* (needs further discussion)
		* (priority #1.5) Plan: meet with Jimmy and run through onboarding, and ask for guidance on how it should work
		* Simon's concerns:
			* Requires a architecture shift
			* Could have long-lasting effects
			* UX concerns
		* Lets build "append" functionality (for now) and see how it goes with jimmy
	* Some wording tweaks
	* Remove duplicate content (codeblocks in note 2)
	* Markdown issues:
		* Some [] expansions did not work
		* `[]<space>` should always make a checklist item, fuck soft breaks
	* UI issues
		* Scroll position persists across notes (rather than being per-note)
	* (TODO cequinne has more)
- Settings note
	* Command shortcut defaults in settings 
		* (needs further discussion): 
			* fundementally the problem we know is default shortcuts are not discoverable)
			* how do we solve the migration problem
			* does that matter for friends of friends (maybe screw early users)
		* (priority #2) Idea:
			* If you modify a shortcut in settings, print out all shortcuts
			* Its okay if it happens multiple times
			* Simon likes it!
- Logging / tracing
	* Bugs:
		* Submit all debugging content for current note
	* Logging
		* We should remove any logging for note content
	* Telemetry
		* Some basic tracking of how much people use the app
		* Probably makes sense once we have more than 10 users
		* Breakdown by feature?
- Surveys
	* Some version outside of onboarding flow
	* First class support would be nice (eventually at least)
		* It would be very easy for us to support this (given we are an editor)
	* Is discord good enough now?
- Discord (priority #3)
	* Basic stuff: Logo, welcome channel, etc.
	* Not more (until people start joining!)
- Website
	* We need a place to market Shelv 
	* Discussion (priority #5)
- Release a new app (priority #4) after:
	1. Latest onboarding tweaks
		1. Wording tweaks (@mirza)
		2. `[] ` item expension (@mirza/@simon pair)
		3. Scroll reset (@mirza)
		4. Append onboarding (@simon)
	2. Jimmy's onboarding session
		1. Record session
		2. Ask about onboarding trigger
	3. Default shortcuts codeblock output (@mirza/@simon or @simon)
	4. Discord basic setup (@simon)
