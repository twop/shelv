- Experimentation
	* We just need a strong boundary between "product" feature and "experimental" feature
		* For example, opt-in experimental features will work
		* Maybe in settings 
- Podcast on product market fit
	* Good survey questions:
		* "Would you be disappointed if you no longer had access to this app?"
		* "Why would you be disappointed?"
		* If 40% of people are disappointed, then you have "product market fit"
			* Only makes sense to grow if you find people like this
