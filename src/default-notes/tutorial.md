# Welcome to Shelv
`Shelv` is a plain text, hackable, ai-enabled notes app that is actually yours.
 
We are so *happy* that you are giving us a chance, and can't wait to learn how *you* use `Shelv` <3.

- [ ] To help you get started with Shelv, we've prepared this note with your onboarding checklist.
- ↑*try clicking this!*

*Tip: A quick way to create a checklist item is by typing `[]` and then hitting `space`. Try it out!*


## Pinned mode
You can control whether Shelv automatically hides or stays on the screen with the pin icon (`󰐃`). When Shelv is pinned, it will stay open even if you switch apps.
Otherwise, **whenever Shelv loses focus, it will hide itself**.

- [ ] Remember `⌘ + ⌥ + s` hotkey! Unpin Shelv by clicking the `󰐃` icon and try clicking outside the window, then use the global hotkey (`⌘ + ⌥ + s`) to return to Shelv.


## Global Hotkey: `⌘ + ⌥ + s`
The best way to use Shelv is with the **global hotkey**. You can use it to quickly show and hide Shelv. The hotkey works no matter what app you are using.

If you'd prefer a different shortcut, it can be configured in [settings](shelv://settings).

*If Shelv is pinned then global hotkey will switch focus back and forth instead of hiding it*


## Tray icon
Shelv lives in the tray (the top menu bar by the clock) as an icon. You can always open Shelv by clicking on this icon (kinda looks like "shelves" `󰇼`)

- [ ] Hide Shelv with the tray icon by clicking it, and then again to bring Shelv back.

*Note that Shelv is a **floating** app, that means it will not appear in "Cmd + Tab" list of apps*

## Quick Prompt
One of the core fetatures of Shelv is quick access to AI, try to select this line, then press `⌃(ctrl) + enter` and type "spellcheck".

*Tip: You can use it to ask for help with configuring settings or asking questions about current shortcuts.*


## Live JS code blocks
You can do quick math or even write mini programs in shelv directly by making `js` code blocks to come "alive"

*Click run button or ⌘ + enter inside the block, then try tweak some numbers*

```js
const days = 4
const workingHours = 8
days * workingHours
```
