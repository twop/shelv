# Welcome to **Shelv**

We are so *happy* that you are giving a us chance <3.

Shelv is a blend of note taking apps and computational notebooks optimized for ideation/draft: `not all notes are meant to be eternal`.

We (the dev team) use it for interview notes, links from research, quick AI access, daily notes + todos, calculator  and much more!

Let's start:

- [ ] Assign **global hotkey**
	* click on `gear` icon below or press `cmd + comma`
	* uncomment the line that starts with "UNCOMMENT"
- [ ] Explore **markdown features**
	* click on `2` below or press `cmd + 2`

## Useful to know

Some quorks and key features:
- lives only in tray, that is, you *can't* "cmd + tab" into it.
- plain text + markdown => easy interop with other apps (like Notion)
- *only 4* notes, and they don't even have names. And, yes, we want more notes too, working on it!

Our tentitive tagline: `Hackable playground for ephemeral thoughts`, whatever that means. Please give us feedback on that btw!
