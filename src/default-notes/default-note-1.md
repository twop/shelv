# Welcome to Shelv

Shelv is a blend of note-taking and computation, optimized for the creative process. We believe that `not all notes are meant to be eternal`, and Shelv is your sketchpad for ephemeral text.

We (the dev team) use it for all our daily note-taking needs like todos, meeting notes, research, and more!

We are so *happy* that you are giving us a chance, and can't wait to learn how *you* use Shelv <3.


## How to use Shelv

To help you get started with Shelv, we've pre-filled your notes with an interactive onboarding tutorial. In each note, there are quick tasks provided so you can try out the features of Shelv. Have fun!

- [ ] **Tasks look like this**
- ↑*try clicking this! (we'll learn more about checklists later)*


### Global Hotkey:`⌘ + ⌥ + s`

The best way to use Shelv is with the **global hotkey**. Use it to quickly summon Shelv, and again to dismiss. The hotkey will continue to work even while using other apps!

- [ ] **Try the global hotkey to hide Shelv**, and then again to show Shelv.

***Note**: While Shelv is running in the background, **it will override shortcuts of other apps**. If you'd prefer a different shortcut, it can be configured in settings.*

- [ ] **(optional) Assign a custom global hotkey** in [settings](shelv://settings)


### Pinning

When you first open Shelv, the **Always On Top** mode is enabled. This is controlled by a pin icon (`󰐃`) in the topbar.

- [ ] **Turn off "Always On Top" mode**  by clicking the `󰐃` icon
- [ ] **Click outside the Shelv window** and Shelv will go away, then use the hotkey to bring Shelv back.


### Tray Icon

**Shelv lives in the tray** (the top menu bar by the clock) as an icon. You can always open Shelv by clicking on this icon (kinda looks like "shelves" `󰇼`)

- [ ] **Hide Shelv with the tray icon** by cicking it, and then again to bring Shelv back.
