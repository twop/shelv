# Welcome to **Shelv**

Shelv blends note-taking and computation, and is optimized for drafting and playing with ideas. We believe that `not all notes are meant to be eternal`, and Shelv is your sketchpad for text.

We (the dev team) use it for all our daily note-taking needs like todos, meeting notes, research, and more!

We are so *happy* that you are giving a us chance, and can't wait to learn how *you* use Shelv <3.

## Onboarding

Let's start:

- [ ] Assign a **global hotkey** in `settings` to summon/dismiss Shelv
  - *Tip: open settings by clicking the `gear` icon in the bottom bar or press `⌘ + comma`*
- [ ] Explore **markdown features** in note `2`
  - *Tip: Switch notes by clicking the tabs in the bottom bar (or use the hotkey like: `⌘ + 2`)*
- [ ] Learn about **code blocks** in note `3`
- [ ] **Share your feedback with us** in note `4`


## Useful to know


Some quirks and key features:
- **Shelv only lives in the tray** (top menu bar by the clock), thus you *can't* `⌘ + tab` into it nor find it in the dock. 
- In Shelv, your notes are always plain-text. It may feel constraining, but we believe it's worth it. For example, copy-pasting your notes is always interopable with other apps.
- **Shelv intentionally only supports 4 notes** (numbered 1-4), and we know this can feel limiting. We're still playing with different ideas how to organize notes (while emphasizing ephemeral use-cases), so if you have opinons/ideas, please share!

Our tentitive tagline: `Hackable playground for ephemeral thoughts`, whatever that means. Please give us feedback on that btw!
