# Welcome to **Shelv**

Shelv is a blend of note-taking and computation, optimized for ideation and drafts. It aims to be a distraction-free enviornment to support quick capture of ideas and a playground for creativity.

We (the dev team) use it for all our daily note-taking needs like todos, meeting notes, research, and more. But the magic sauce of Shelv is the ability to compute within notes.

We are so _happy_ that you are giving a us chance, and can't wait to learn how _you_ use Shelv <3.

## Onboarding

To help you get started with Shelv, we've provided a helpful onboarding checklist throughout your notes.
_Tip: Feel free to clear everything when you're done!_

- [ ] Assign a **global hotkey** in `settings` to summon/dismiss Shelv
  - _Tip: open settings by clicking the `gear` icon in the bottom bar or press `cmd + comma`_
- [ ] Explore **markdown features** in note `2`
  - _Tip: Switch notes by clicking the tabs in the bottom bar (or use the hotkey like: `cmd + 2`)_
- [ ] Learn about **code blocks** in note `3`
- [ ] **Share your feedback with us** in note `4`

## Useful to know

Some quirks (or features!)

- **Shelv won't show up in your dock or `cmd + tab` list**, it stays out of the way so you can switch between your other apps. Use the global shortcut defined in settings to summon or dismiss Shelv.
- **Shelv lives as a tray icon in the Apple menu bar**, and it's another way to open Shelv. To quit Shelv, right click on the icon to open the menu.
- **Shelv intentionally only supports 4 notes**, which are numbered 1-4 (for now). We're still exploring different ways of organizing notes, and we'd love to hear your feedback!
