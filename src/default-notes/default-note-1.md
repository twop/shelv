# Welcome to Shelv

## How to use Shelv

To help you get started with Shelv, we've pre-filled your notes with an interactive onboarding guide. Each section has tasks indicated with a checkbox.

- [ ] ←**Tasks look like this**. Click the box after finishing (try it right now!)

### Global Hotkey

Shelv works a bit different than most apps. For example, Shelv won't show up as a window when you press `⌘ + tab`tab. The best way to open Shelv is to use the **global hotkey**.

- [ ] **Assign your global hotkey** in `settings` (to open settings, click the `` icon in the bottom bar)
- [ ] **Try your new hotkey to hide Shelv**, and then again to bring Shelv back.


### Pinning

When you first open Shelv, the **Always On Top** mode is enabled. This is controlled by a pin icon (`󰐃`) in the topbar.

- [ ] **Turn off "Always On Top" mode**  by clicking the `󰐃` icon
- [ ] **Click outside Shelv to hide**. Then use the hotke to bring Shelv back.


### Tray Icon

**Shelv lives in the tray** (the top menu bar by the clock) as an icon (of our logo!). You can always open Shelv by clicking on this icon (kinda looks like `󰇼`)

- [ ] **Hide Shelv with the tray icon** by cicking it, and then again to bring Shelv back.
