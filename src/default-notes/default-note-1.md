# Welcome to Shelv
Shelv is a blend of note-taking and computation, optimized for the creative process. We believe that `not all notes are meant to be eternal`, and Shelv is your sketchpad for ephemeral text. We (the dev team) use it for all our daily note-taking needs like todos, meeting notes, research, and more!

We are so *happy* that you are giving us a chance, and can't wait to learn how *you* use Shelv <3.

- [ ] To help you get started with Shelv, we've prepared this note with your onboarding checklist.
- ↑*try clicking this!*

*Tip: A quick way to create a checklist item is by typing `[]` and then hitting `space`. Try it out!*

## Global Hotkey: `⌘ + ⌥ + s`
The best way to use Shelv is with the **global hotkey**. Use it to quickly show and hide Shelv. The hotkey works no matter what app you are using.

- [ ] Use the global hotkey (`⌘ + ⌥ + s`) to hide Shelv, and then again to show Shelv.

*Note: While Shelv is running in the background, it will override shortcuts of other apps. If you'd prefer a different shortcut, it can be configured in [settings](shelv://settings).*

## Pinned mode
You can control whether Shelv automatically hides or stays on the screen with the pin icon (`󰐃`). When Shelv is pinned, it will stay open even if you switch apps. Otherwise, whenever Shelv loses focus, it will get out of your way.

- [ ] Unpin Shelv by clicking the `󰐃` icon and try clicking outside the window, then use the global hotkey (`⌘ + ⌥ + s`) to return to Shelv.

## Tray icon
Shelv lives in the tray (the top menu bar by the clock) as an icon. You can always open Shelv by clicking on this icon (kinda looks like "shelves" `󰇼`)

- [ ] Hide Shelv with the tray icon by clicking it, and then again to bring Shelv back.
