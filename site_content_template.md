## Content Guidelines

### Tone of Voice
- **Technical but approachable**: Smart without being intimidating
- **Action-oriented**: Focus on what users can do
- **Authentic**: Avoid marketing fluff, be direct about capabilities

### Key Messaging Themes

2. **Hackability**: Extensible and customizable without requiring programming skills
3. **Foundation**: Solid, reliable note-taking with modern features
4. **Speed**: Quick capture, instant access, efficient workflows

### Visual Strategy
- Use actual app screenshots and GIFs, not mockups
- Show real workflows, not perfect demo scenarios  
- Highlight the AI and customization features prominently
- Keep the Nord color scheme consistent with app branding
